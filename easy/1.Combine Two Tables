Table: Person
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
Primary Key(PK): PersonId 

Table: Address
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
Primary Key(PK): AddressId 

Requirement:
FirstName, LastName, City, State for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people

Explanation:
1. As address info is needed, join Person and Address table;
2. A person might have no address, but person's info must be returned, thus Person LEFT JOIN Address
   A LEFT JOIN B: return entire A and matched part of B, unmateched data of B remains NULL

Oracle Query:
   SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, a.City, a.State
   FROM Person p
   LEFT JOIN Address a
   ON p.PersonId = a.PersonId;
